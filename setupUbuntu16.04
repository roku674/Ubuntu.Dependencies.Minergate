**************Using Digital Ocean to Mine***********

#do this for setup---


1) First use this link for a free starter 10 dollars https://m.do.co/c/13a05501eee8 (this link doesn't benefit me unless you spend money on their site only gives you that starter 10)

2) make an account if you link a card you won't be charged until that free 10 dollars runs out so make sure you keep an eye on it and cancel the account in 1 month (1 account per card)

3) (2x)Make a 5 dollar droplets (I Usually use New York 1) (simplified instructions https://medium.com/@Jayvdb/how-to-start-mining-cryptocurrency-for-fun-and-possibly-profit-71517859ed91)
If you're feelin froggy you can go for the 3 vCPU for 15 dollars each this gets me about 90-110 h/s XMR per Droplet but make sure you cancel before your $10 credits run out

4) go to your email and use it to log in and create your new password if the rightclick copy at the top left isnt working you gotta type the whole thing so don't mess up
